This web application was created for a Fall 2015 course in server-side programming and development.

It is written in Python with a jinja2 templating framework (per course specification). It is compiled with Google App Engine and uses ndb.Models to store information to the GAE datastore.

I may update this file to implement more features, redesign the (ugly) UI, and work on it's code efficiency.

Currently, I want to implement JSON to initialize the default ingredients, but I'm still learning everything so we shall see.
