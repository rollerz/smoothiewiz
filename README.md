# smoothiewiz Alpha 1.2
#### Deployed version can be viewed at http://smoothiewiz.appspot.com/

This web application was created for a Fall 2015 course in server-side programming and development.

It is written in Python with a jinja2 template framework (per course specification). It is compiled/deployed with Google App Engine and uses ndb.Models to send information to the GAE datastore.

##### Redesigned with Bootstrap, jQueryValidation, JSON defaults.

###### NOTE: At the time of writing this I have not implemented any privacy/security features on this site! Even account passwords are not hashed or encrypted in any way, so please for god sake don't use actual account credentials! Password encryption is something I obviously hope to implement in a future update.
